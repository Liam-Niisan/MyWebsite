# Robert Barham's About Me Music Website

My webite is a biography page for myself as a musician. It features 3 different webpages: Home, Blog, and Contact. All the pages have a site logo (placeholder image) and navigation bar in the header and most of the text used is Lorem Ipsum. The blog page would be for social media and other pictures and videos of my material, and the contact page has a contact me form for any services I can provide or questions I can answer. Lastly the home page contains any general info about me, what i can do as a musician, and my instruments.

The 4 features i implemented in my project:

CSS Requirements

1.) A navigation bar that expands and collapses properly at mobile and desktop sizes. 

2.) I used flexbox to create the navigation bar.

3.) On my blog page since I don't have any videos or social media to post yet I made a CSS animation of a loading spinner and bouncing dots to emulate an infinite loading screen.

Javascript Requirements

4.) I made a contact form on the contact page that requires you to put valid information into all the text fields or the form will not let you submit it. It requires at least 2 characters in the Name field, an @ symbol in the email field and a minimum of 6 characters, and the message has to contain at least 5 characters as well. If all those fields are meet, you will see an alert message saying the form is submitted.
